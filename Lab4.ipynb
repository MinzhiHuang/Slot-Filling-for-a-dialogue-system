It has an impressively detailed annotation involving multiple turns and multiple goals which we have simplified to just the initiating request (first turn) and involving two possible intents and the corresponding slots for those intents. Download the data from [github](https://github.ubc.ca/MDS-CL-2023-24/COLX_563_adv-semantics_students/tree/master/data/lab4/Multiwoz.zip), unzip it into a directory outside of your lab repo and change the path below."
